# ycombinator
Implements a Y-combinator [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Fixed_point_combinators_in_lambda_calculus] using Python lambda functions

It's a bit difficult to understand what's really going on inside a Y-combinator without trying to implement it 
and manually step through it's execution, so this might be helpful.
